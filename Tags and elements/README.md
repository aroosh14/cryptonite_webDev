### Report: Elements and Tags in HTML

**Overview**
This lesson aims to:
- Explain what HTML tags are.
- Explain what HTML elements are.

**Understanding Elements and Tags**
HTML elements consist of content wrapped in tags. These tags tell the browser how to interpret and display the content. 

- **Opening Tags**: These mark the start of an element and are enclosed in angle brackets, like `<p>` for a paragraph.
- **Closing Tags**: These mark the end of an element and look similar to the opening tag but with a forward slash, like `</p>`.
  
For example, a paragraph element might look like this:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
In this case:
- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- `This is a paragraph.` is the content.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.

Think of an HTML element as a container that holds content. The tags surrounding the content define what the element is, and the browser uses that to decide how to format or display the content.

**Importance of Tags**
HTML has a large number of predefined tags that correspond to different elements, such as paragraphs, headings, links, images, and more. It's important to use the correct tags because:
- Proper tags improve search engine optimization (SEO) by helping search engines understand your content.
- Tags also enhance accessibility, allowing assistive technologies like screen readers to correctly interpret your webpage's content.

This practice of using the right tags for the right content is called **semantic HTML**, which we'll explore further in future lessons.

**Void Elements**
Not all HTML elements need closing tags. Some are known as **void elements** because they donâ€™t wrap content. These elements include tags like `<br>` (for a line break) or `<img>` (for an image).

Void elements are unique because they do not require a closing tag. You may encounter self-closing tags (like `<br />` or `<img />`) which were historically used, but the current HTML standard discourages this practice.
