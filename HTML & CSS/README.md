HTML vs. CSS vs. JavaScript: A Comparison
1. HTML: Structure & Layout
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web. It acts as the foundation of a webpage, organizing everything from text and images to links and headers. Essentially, HTML is responsible for arranging how content is presented on a webpage.

Purpose: It organizes and displays content.
Examples of use: Structuring paragraphs, embedding images, adding links, or building forms.
2. CSS: Styling & Design
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual appearance of a webpage. It allows developers to style HTML elements by defining properties like colors, fonts, and layouts. With CSS, you can make a site visually appealing by controlling the design aspects.

Purpose: Enhances the look and feel of a website.
Examples of use: Changing text color, adjusting spacing, defining fonts, or creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
3. JavaScript: Interactivity
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic content to websites. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are static, JavaScript allows developers to make pages respond to user actions such as clicks or keyboard input. It is used to manipulate HTML and CSS in real-time.

Purpose: Introduces dynamic functionality and interaction to the site.
Examples of use: Creating animations, validating forms, interactive sliders, or showing/hiding content based on user input.
4. The Relationship Between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
These three languages are complementary. HTML builds the structure, CSS refines the appearance, and JavaScript adds behavior and interactivity. Together, they form a cohesive system for web development.

5. Beyond the Basics: Other Web Development Languages
Other programming languages, such as PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL, are used for backend development, data processing, and database management. However, for most front-end development, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is sufficient.
